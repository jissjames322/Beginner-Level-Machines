# Beginner-Level-Machines ðŸ’»
These are Beginner Level Machines from TCM [Cyber Mentor YT]
You can find these in the 15hr Ethical Hacking Video on their Channel 

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for the machines I've completed so far, including:
```
- Kioptrix Level 1
- Blackpearl
```
These machines are from a 1-year-old video series, but they still provide valuable learning experiences. I've completed some of these machines by following along with the instructor, and others I've attempted on my own. I've also referenced walkthroughs from other learners to help me overcome challenges.

Ongoing Project

I still have a few more machines to complete, and I'll be adding them to this repository as I finish. This is an ongoing project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.
