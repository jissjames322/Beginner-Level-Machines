# Beginner-Level-Machines ðŸ’»
These are Beginner Level Machines from TCM [Cyber Mentor YT]
You can find these in the 15hr Ethical Hacking Video on their Channel 
These Box's where given as **PEH Capstone**  

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for the machines I've completed so far, including:
```
- Kioptrix Level 1
- Blackpearl
- Blue
- Dev
- Acadmey
- Butler
```
The `Butler` Machine caused  so much lag in my  `Virtual Box` because i am using a low end device and it was a `Windows 10` based machine which atleast needs upto 4GB of Ram Allocated to it even with 2GB I had some problems of CPU Heating.I think i should just do HTB Machines so you dont have to worry about any other things.   

These machines are from a 1-year-old video series, but they still provide valuable learning experiences. I've completed some of these machines by following along with the instructor, and others I've attempted on my own. I've also referenced walkthroughs from other learners to help me overcome challenges.

Ongoing Project

I still have a few more machines to complete, and I'll be adding them to this repository as I finish. This is an ongoing project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.

Please note that these machines are for educational purposes only. I do not condone or promote illegal hacking activities.

Acknowledgments

Thanks to Cyber Mentor (TCM) for providing the course materials and machines. I've also appreciated the help from other learners' walkthroughs, which have assisted me in completing these challenges.
