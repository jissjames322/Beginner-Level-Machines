# Beginner-Level-Machines ðŸ’»
These are Beginner Level Machines from TCM [Cyber Mentor YT]
You can find these in the 15hr Ethical Hacking Video on their Channel 

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for the machines I've completed so far, including:
```
- Kioptrix Level 1
- Blackpearl
```
These machines are from a 1-year-old video series, but they still provide valuable learning experiences. I've completed some of these machines by following along with the instructor, and others I've attempted on my own. I've also referenced walkthroughs from other learners to help me overcome challenges.

Ongoing Project

I still have a few more machines to complete, and I'll be adding them to this repository as I finish. This is an ongoing project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.

Disclaimer

Please note that these machines are for educational purposes only. I do not condone or promote illegal hacking activities.

Acknowledgments

Thanks to Cyber Mentor (TCM) for providing the course materials and machines. I've also appreciated the help from other learners' walkthroughs, which have assisted me in completing these challenges.
